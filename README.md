### Check your mail sieve in your browser

You can see a live demo (hosted on GitHub Pages) here: [https://checksieve.com](https://checksieve.com)

This project uses the [check-sieve](https://github.com/dburkart/check-sieve) library compiled down to WebAssembly to check sieve syntax entirely in your browser (no servers involved!).

#### Run it locally

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
```

You can now navigate to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) and check your sieve in your browser!
